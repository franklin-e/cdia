I donâ€™t remember exactly when Budberg died, it was either two years   
      ago or three.   
The same with Chen. Whether last year or the one before.   
Soon after our arrival, Budberg, gently pensive,   
Said that in the beginning it is hard to get accustomed,   
For here there is no spring or summer, no winter or fall.
